# hello-world
Hello! My name is Christian Harrison! I'm a 23 year old who works at the Macy's Fulfillment Center, living with my aunt and sister. I'm also a big gamer and wrestling fan.
I used to take Taekwondo, I draw from time to time, and I'm quite fond of dogs, cats, and ducks.
I make my own music.
